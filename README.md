Cloud Resume Challenge

This project is my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, designed to showcase practical experience in cloud computing and full-stack development using AWS.
Features

    Resume Website
    Built with HTML and CSS, styled as a personal resume and hosted on Amazon S3 with HTTPS via CloudFront.

    Visitor Counter
    A JavaScript-based visitor counter that connects to a REST API built with API Gateway, triggering a Lambda function written in Python, and storing data in DynamoDB.

    CI/CD Pipeline
    Integrated GitHub Actions to automatically test, build, and deploy updates to the S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront cache.

    Infrastructure & Deployment
    The entire system simulates production-like cloud deployment, with serverless architecture, version control, and automated workflows.
