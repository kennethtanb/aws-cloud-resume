## 💡Features

- ### Resume Website
	Built with HTML and CSS, styled as a personal resume and hosted on Amazon S3 with HTTPS via CloudFront.

- ### Visitor Counter
	A JavaScript-based visitor counter that connects to a REST API built with API Gateway, triggering a Lambda function written in Python, and storing data in DynamoDB.

- ### CI/CD Pipeline
	Integrated GitHub Actions to automatically test, build, and deploy updates to the S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront cache.

- ### Infrastructure & Deployment
	The entire system simulates production-like cloud deployment, with serverless architecture, version control, and automated workflows.

## 🔧Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
